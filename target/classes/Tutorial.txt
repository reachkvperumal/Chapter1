Streams follow the “what, not how” principle. In our stream example, we describe what needs to be done: get the long words and count them. We don’t specify in which order, or in which thread, this should happen. In contrast, the loop at the beginning of this section specifies exactly how the computation should work, and thereby forgoes any chances of optimization.
